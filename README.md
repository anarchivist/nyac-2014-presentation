Title: Among Place and Non-Place: Situating the Digital Public Library of America

Abstract:

> The Digital Public Library of America (http://dp.la) brings together the riches of Americaâ€™s libraries, archives, and museums, and makes them freely available to the world through its portal for discovery, its platform enabling new and transformative use of digital cultural heritage, and advocacy for a strong public option for access to cultural heritage materials. In this session, we will be considering how DPLA has situated itself in terms of place in three ways: through its network of hubs and partners, through its Community Reps program, and through geocoding items and their presentation on a map in our portal. We will also discuss future possibilities for how a geographically distributed digital library could help foster a stronger connection between its user community and physical place.
